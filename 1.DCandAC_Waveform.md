# DC Circuit and Waveform  
>> Direct Current or D.C. as it is more commonly called, is a form of electrical current or voltage that flows around an electrical circuit in one direction only, making it a “Uni-directional” supply [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/accircuits/ac-waveform.html]

DC power supplies do not change their value with regards to time.  
DC maintains the same value for all times and a constant uni-directional DC supply never changes or becomes negative unless its connections are physically reversed.

# AC Circuit and Waveform  
>> AC Waveform varies in both magnitude and direction with respect to time (Bi-Directional) and a mathematical sinusoid being defined as <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=A(t)&space;=&space;A_{max}\ast&space;sin&space;(2\pi&space;ft)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A(t)&space;=&space;A_{max}\ast&space;sin&space;(2\pi&space;ft)" title="A(t) = A_{max}\ast sin (2\pi ft)" /></a>

AC Waveform Characteristics  
* The Period (T)
* The Frequency (F)  
* The Amplitude (A)
