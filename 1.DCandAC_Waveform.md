# DC Circuit and Waveform  
```
Direct Current or D.C. as it is more commonly called, is a form of electrical current or voltage that flows around an electrical circuit in one direction only, making it a “Uni-directional” supply.
```  
DC power supplies do not change their value with regards to time.  
DC maintains the same value for all times and a constant uni-directional DC supply never changes or becomes negative unless its connections are physically reversed.
