## DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING  

Analog-To-Digital Converter has three steps :  
* Sampling means to change continuous-analog signal would be discrete-analog signal at certain periods.
* Quantization means to equalize discrete-analog signal with one value of defined finite amplitude.  
* Coding means to change discrete-amplitude would be digital code.
