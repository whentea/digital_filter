# FILTER DESIGN  
Filter design is  
```the process of designing a signal processing filter that satisfies a set of requirements, some of which are contradictory.```  
The purpose is to find a realization of the filter that meets each of the requirements to a sufficient degree to make it useful.  
The filter design process can be described as an optimization problem where each requirement contributes to an error function which should be minimized.
