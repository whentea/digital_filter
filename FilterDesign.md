# FILTER DESIGN  
* Filter design is  
```the process of designing a signal processing filter that satisfies a set of requirements, some of which are contradictory.```  
* The purpose is  
```to find a realization of the filter that meets each of the requirements to a sufficient degree to make it useful.```  
* The filter design process can be described as  
```an optimization problem where each requirement contributes to an error function which should be minimized.```

Typical requirements which are considered in the design filter process are a specific frequency response, a specific phase shift, a specific impulse response, causal, stable, should be localized, the computational complexity of the filter should be low and should be implemented in particular hardware or software.
